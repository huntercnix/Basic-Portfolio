            <p>
                I am a 28 year old aspiring developer. I grew up playing all kinds of sports and never thought further than that.
                Now I am on to this new adventure and couldn't be happier. I love going to TCU football games, tailgating, cycling,
                and sitting in a pool with a beer on a hot day.
